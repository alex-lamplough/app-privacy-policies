            <h1>💧 Wavely Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Your health data is yours alone</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong><span class="emoji">✨</span> Privacy-First Approach</strong></p>
                <p>Wavely is designed with privacy at its core. Your health and wellness data stays under YOUR control. We use Apple's secure iCloud to sync your data across your devices, but we never collect, analyze, or sell your personal information.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Information We DON'T Collect</h2>
            <p>We take pride in what we don't do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No personal information</strong> - We don't collect your name, email, phone number, or any identifying information beyond what Apple provides for purchase verification</li>
                <li><strong>No usage analytics</strong> - We don't track how you use the app or what features you access</li>
                <li><strong>No advertising data</strong> - We don't serve ads or collect advertising identifiers</li>
                <li><strong>No location data</strong> - We don't access or collect your location</li>
                <li><strong>No third-party tracking</strong> - We don't use analytics services, crash reporters, or any third-party tracking tools</li>
                <li><strong>No selling of data</strong> - We never sell, rent, or share your data with third parties</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Data We Store</h2>
            <p>Wavely stores wellness data that you create while using the app. All data is stored locally on your device and optionally synced to your private iCloud account:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water intake entries</strong> - Date, time, amount, and unit of measurement for each water entry you log</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration goals</strong> - Your custom daily water goal and preferred measurement unit (mL or oz)</li>
                <li><strong>Fasting records</strong> - Start/end times, duration, target duration, and completion status of water fasts</li>
                <li><strong>Breathwork sessions</strong> - Date, exercise type, duration, and completion status</li>
                <li><strong>Meditation sessions</strong> - Date, duration, ambient sound selection, and completion status</li>
                <li><strong>Journal reflections</strong> - Mood, notes, session type, session name, and duration for sessions you reflect on</li>
                <li><strong>Streaks and statistics</strong> - Current streak count, longest streak, last check-in date, and cumulative stats</li>
                <li><strong>Profile information</strong> - Optional display name and profile image you choose to set</li>
                <li><strong>App preferences</strong> - Settings like notification preferences, reminder times, quiet hours, and onboarding completion status</li>
                <li><strong>Purchase status</strong> - Whether premium features are unlocked via in-app purchase</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Store Your Data</h2>
            <p>Wavely uses a two-tier storage approach for maximum privacy and reliability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data is first saved locally on your device using Apple's secure UserDefaults framework</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud Sync (Optional):</strong> Your data automatically syncs to your private iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit framework</li>
                <li>You can use Wavely completely offline - internet connection is only needed for iCloud sync</li>
                <li>All iCloud data is stored in YOUR personal iCloud account, not on our servers</li>
                <li>We don't have access to your iCloud data - only your devices can read it</li>
                <li>iCloud data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>iCloud Sync & Privacy</h2>
            <p>Wavely uses Apple's CloudKit to sync your data across your devices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CloudKit stores data in YOUR private iCloud account, not on our servers</li>
                <li>Only devices signed into your Apple ID can access your synced data</li>
                <li>We cannot access, view, or retrieve your iCloud data</li>
                <li>CloudKit sync happens automatically in the background when you have an internet connection</li>
                <li>Your data syncs across all devices logged into the same Apple ID</li>
                <li>If you disable iCloud for Wavely in iOS Settings, data will only be stored locally</li>
                <li>iCloud storage counts toward your personal iCloud storage quota (typically a few KB)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Notifications</h2>
            <p>Wavely uses local notifications for wellness reminders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All notifications are scheduled and delivered locally on your device</li>
                <li>You can enable custom reminder times and hourly reminders</li>
                <li>Quiet hours (9PM-7AM) can be enabled to silence notifications during sleep</li>
                <li>We do not collect or transmit any notification data</li>
                <li>You can enable/disable reminders anytime in the Reminders screen</li>
                <li>Notification permissions are managed by iOS</li>
                <li>Notifications include motivational messages and goal achievement celebrations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>Wavely offers premium features through a pay-what-you-want model:</p>

                <li>Purchase history is managed by Apple and synced via your Apple ID</li>
                <li>We only receive confirmation that a purchase was made (no payment details)</li>

                <li>Premium features include: extended fasting presets, custom fasting durations, streak recovery, and future premium content</li>
                <li>Your premium status automatically syncs across all devices signed into your Apple ID</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Wavely does not currently integrate with Apple Health:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>All data tracking happens within Wavely only</li>

                <li>If Health integration is added, you will have full control over what data is shared</li>
            </ul>
